# Code-implementation-of-a-simple-classifier
Code implementation of a simple classifier for Bearing Fault Diagnosis (BFD), based on the "Intra and Inter Wavelet-subband Sparse Model" proposed in the related paper. The repository adopts SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Random Forest as core classification models, providing a lightweight reference for reproducing wavelet-based bearing fault diagnosis tasks.
